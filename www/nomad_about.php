		<h3 class='font-questrial text-left'><u>My adult life in a nutshell and how I got into this industry:</u></h3>
		<p class='font-questrial text-indent-10'>After graduating high school, I enrolled in college and went to school, got on the traditional all-american plan. During my second year of college I ran into some extreme difficulties
		with the death of my mother. I still finished my two year degree but that emotional stress along with my father being chronically ill at a fairly young age (50s) made me contemplate exactly what was the point of everything</p>
		<p class='font-questrial text-indent-10'>This helped solidify for me, the fact that we are all here on this earth for a limited amount of time, and that the quality of life is not 
		determined by college degrees, or money, but the manner in which you enrich it</p>
		<p class='font-questrial text-indent-10'>It really all started for me after moving back home from a failed job experience in Michigan. I found a job on craigslist looking for line cooks on Block Island, RI. 
		They provided housing!!! My what an opportunity! I applied immediately and within a few days went out to meet the owners of the restaurant, in another month I was living 13 miles out to sea</p>

		<h3 class='font-questrial text-left'><u>My goals</u></h3>
		<p class='font-questrial text-indent-10'>I have quite a few, although I've rarely written any of them down. A wise man once told me that people who write there goals down are more likely to reach them.
			<ul>
				<li>To become a full-stack web developer</li>
				<li>Own a company</li>
				<li>Have a job that doesn't involve going to work</li>
				<li>Take an active part in saving the eco-systems of planet earth</li>
				<li>Voluntourism</li>
				<li>Visit every country on earth</li>
				<li>Share all this knowledge with others</li>
				<li>Live off the grid (but still get internet!)</li>
				<li>Perfect being a modern nomad</li>
