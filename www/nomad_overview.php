		<p class='overview-answer'>I am doing this for numerous reasons, but the main two are pretty straight forward
		<ul>
			<li><u>Web Development</u> - I originally created the idea for the subject matter for this website after needing to have something to write about, seasonal living and moving
			happens to be something I know quite a lot about</li>
			<li><u>Knowledge Sharing</u> - When I first started out in this industry I remember barely finding any information whatsoever on this kind of lifestyle, I hope, with the help
			of other experienced people in the community, to be able to offer a comprehensive resource to people who are interested in living this way</li>

		<p class='overview-answer'>Seasonal living is by definition a nomadic lifestyle. A person will move to a different location for work depending on the time of year. For example,
		a person could work at a beach town in the summertime and then at a ski resort in the winter time. If winter isn't for you, it's just as easy to head on down to the 
		US Virgin Islands, or one of the other many tropical paradises found in the caribbean and gulf coast. I personally have yet to find a more stimulating and refreshing way to live
		your life than to constantly be on the move and exploring new places and learning new things. You're not confined to any particular line of work either, depending on what you like
		there is something for everyone. I will go over a list of jobs common to the seasonal industry in the <a href="/jobs">Jobs</a> section
